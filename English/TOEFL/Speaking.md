  1. For a country's success, I think a well-rounded medical care system is the most important.
  2. And that's because if you are not healthy, you can't afford to take advantage of business opportunities. And you probably won't be able to focus on your education either. Only after you are healthy, can you go and take advantage of the other two. There are many countries around the world where there might be a good business environment. But because there is not a sufficient medical care system, it actually holds back the development of that country.
  3. So that is why I think it's the most important.

  1. As far as I'm concerned, it's better for university freshmen to live on campus.
  2. First of all, for university first-year students, it's more convenient to live in the dormitories, since they can have meal and go to the supermarket on campus. Because they are not familiar with the situation around campus, they don't have to go far away off campus to buy groceries.
  3. Furthermore, it's much safer to live on campus. As we know, every university has its own Security Office which can guarantee the safety of  the students.
  4. Therefore, I prefer the first-year university students should live on campus.
* s
  1. I prefer to work on assignments individually. There are two reasons.
  2. Firstly, I like to be in a quiet place while studying. If I study in a group, I will easily be interrupted by other group members who talk about irrelevant things.
  3. The second reason is that I'd like to think independently. Studying individually gives me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I'm afraid I will be distracted by other's opinions and thoughts. Like last week, I worked in a group to solve math problems. It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.
* 
  1. Personally speaking, going to a new place is more memorable and feels longer than, for example, a seventh straight visit to the Great Wall.
  2. Traveling to a new place makes me feel like a kid again. I like the feeling of being excited and curious before I make my trip to somewhere new. Nowadays, people's jobs come with relatively less vacation time than before, and they should think about avoiding repeating visits to places they've already enjoyed.
  3. Furthermore, I deeply believe that new experiences increase resourcefulness. I have noticed that people who tend to travel to new places feel more ready to embrace change and have a natural ability to overcome problems that others would have difficulties with.
* s
  1. Personally, I prefer living in a historic house.
  2. One of the great reasons why I would choose to live there is the gorgeous design and other details that unique and different about an old historic house, like deliberately designed wooden doors and tea-colored glass windows.
  3. Also living in a historic house will provide me  a richer understanding of history. It offers a taste about the past of the local area, and it could turn you even into a historian. Whether you are really good at history or not, the cool historic house will help you get interested in history.
* s
  1. I don't think people need the so-called talent to be an artist.
  2. I deeply believe that everyone has a potential to be an artist if they choose to be one. I'm sure we've heard enough stories about such and such artist who was not considered to be talented at the time, but became very successful in his or her own style of art.
  3. In my opinion, art has elements of SKILL. If you never learn those basic skills and steps, then of course you will have limited skill! So, people who want to become an accomplished artist should pay a lot of effort to gain the necessary skills in their fields. It is to say that hardwork is far more important than being talented as an artist.
* (Task 1, 记叙文--不考？)
  1. The thing I'd like to talk about today is that I never would've imagined traveling alone to a foreign country.
  2. Last year, I traveled to Thailand all by myself. I only planned the trip for about ten days, and the next thing that happened was me physically being in Thailand. I was like a free bird sight-seeing every day, eating tasty food, and meeting new friends.
  3. In the past, I would never have imagined traveling abroad alone. It sounded uncertain and scary. I often questioned myself that what if I was lost in a foreign country and what would happen if I couldn't communicate with local people. But my last year experience conquered my fear, and now I am very proud of myself.
* s
  1. Personally, I think parents should supervise what their children watch on TV. The reasons are as follow:
  2. Firstly, TV is always flooded with lots of criminal and violent scenes, which are especially bad for children. Parents should prevent them from watching those scenes because they might try to imitate the actions and put them into use.
  3. Secondly, parents should also limit the amount of time children watch TV. If children can choose to watch anything they want, they might end up being addicted to certain TV shows and eventually having poor eyesight. Also, people call those who are overindulgent in watching TV couch potatoes simply because if one spends too much time watching TV shows, he might become obese.
* s
  1. I think learning in traditional classrooms is better.
  2. First of all, I think there are more personal interactions in traditional classrooms than in online courses. Students can have in-person discussions while they can see each other. Possibly, people can become friends in class, whereas in the online courses, students don't know each other, and they miss a chance of making friends.
  3. Also, in a traditional classroom, if a student doesn't understand a concept or an idea, they can raise their hand to ask the teacher directly. While in an online course, there is no chance for students to throw out questions immediately. Students in traditional classrooms not only learn the academic knowledge but also learn basic interpersonal interactions. 
* s
  1. For me, wearing so-called fashionable clothes is not as important, and people shouldn't care much how other people view them based on what they wear.
  2. I think true fashion is about what looks best on you and makes you feel best. It isn't a brand or a certain style that makes you good-looking. I feel like people should find their own style that they like. People often forget that they are beautiful by being themselves and expressing their inner self!
  3. Furthermore, people who dress up fashionably often spend a tremendous amount of time in researching and catching up on the latest trends. In my opinion, that might make people more and more anxious about their appearance and also waste too much time.
* s
  1. I think environmental protection is definitely as import as economic development, if not, more important than the latter one.
  2. We have already wasted and destroyed big amount of natural resources. We must preserve the earth for our children and grandchildren. In any case, poverty and environmental damage are often linked. For example, polluted water can lead to crop failures.
  3. Another reason is that nature plays a key role in human's both physical and mental health. Simply, a beautiful and well-protected environment just makes people and their life happier and more enjoyable. Unfortunately our planet is in danger. Many species of animals and plants are almost extinct.

## Task 3

* 题目
  1. read one passage: 75~100 words, 45/50s
  2. listen to one dialogue: 2 people (a male student & a female student), 60~80s
     * 一个人重点，根据passage针对找观点和理由
  3. preparation: 30s
  4. response: 60s
* Template (模板)
  * The university/student in the reading is planning to + 1句，阅读中的主题. In the dialogue, the man/woman agrees/disagrees with the plan in the reading passage.
  * First of all, he/she thinks that 3-4句话（第一个原因）.
  * (剩20秒) Second, he/she continues saying that 4句话左右（第二个原因）
  * Therefore / in a word / all in all, the man/woman doesn't agree / agrees on ...(阅读中的内容)
* s
  * The Computer Department plans to add evening computer classes because daytime computer classes have become overcrowded. But the man in the conversation thinks it's a bad proposal.
  * First of all, the man says that most of the students have already got their own plans in the evenings. They have jobs, family, clubs and social events, so they won't have time to attend the evening classes.
  * The man also says that it's actually going to cost more to open evening classes than to simply buy more computers, since to open new classes needs to hire new teachers and keep the building open late. However, computer is not expensive now. Plus, the computer classrooms are big enough to hold more computers.
* s
  * The student in the reading suggests that the school should change their bike borrowing program. In the dialogue, the man disagrees with the plan in the reading passage.
  * First, he thinks that students often need to borrow the bikes for a long time, sometimes even a whole day. He takes himself and his friends for example. They often go to a park off campus by riding their bikes on weekends. They'd prefer renting those bikes throughout the entire day. Obviously, it's unrealistic for students to return their bicycles after borrowing them for only four hours.
  * Secondly, he continues saying that it's very inconvenient for students to hand over their student ID cards when borrowing the bikes, simply because they need to use their ID cards to enter many building, such as the dining hall and the library. So, he thinks that requiring students to use ID card to borrow bicycles is not as good as asking them to leave a cash deposit.
  * Therefore, the man doesn't agree on the proposal mentioned in the reading passage.

### Task 4

* 题目
  1. read one passage: 75~100 words, 45/50s (学术名词，介绍一个概念)
  2. listen to one lecture: 1 professor, 60~80s (1+1：一个学术概念+一个具体案例(长))
  3. preparation: 30s (解释示例如何阐明是这个概念的)

  * （剩10s）After all/ In the end/ Finally/ So, ——结论
* 笔记
  * 时间+事件
* 例子Procedural Memory
  * Procedural memory is a specific memory of how to learn a new task. After practicing something many times, people will never forget how to do it, and it becomes a sort of permanent memory.
  * In the listening portion, the professor says that he used to play guitar when he was very young. His teacher taught him how to place his fingers and how to hold a guitar. After he learned it, he played every day at home for many hours. But then he went to college, and he didn't play it for a long time. One day after college, he picked up the guitar and he tried playing it again. Surprisingly he still knew how to play guitar in a perfect way. Although he couldn't explain how or why he could play it, he still can play his favorite songs.
  * And this shows how procedural memory forms.
* 例子Groupthinking
  * The professor in the lecture uses his personal experience in a computer company to illustrate groupthink.
  * Once he and his co-worker suggested  to give their computer a design make-over to look cooler in order to attract new customers. At first, the majority supported their suggestion. But there were a few senior managers who didn't support. Then some supporters changed their mind, so did the professor's co-worker, because they didn't want to make a bad impression on senior managers. Then afterwards, the professor himself thought he was the one delaying the decision. Then, he voted against himself. So they all agreed not to have this design change.
  * At last, the company lost profit because its competitors came up with good-looking computers and won more customers. This shows how bad decision is made by groupthink.
* 例子Heart Valve Replacement
  * In this lecture, the professor talks about two different kinds of heart valves.
  * One type of heart valves is called the porcine valve. It's made from a pig, because pig valves are natural and easy to be adapted by the human body. After surgery, patients need little treatment. However, this kind of valve doesn't last more than a decade. This makes it an ideal choice for elderly patients.
  * The other heart valve option is an artificial one, which is made of plastic and metal. These valves can last much longer than pig valves. Unfortunately, they can also cause blood clots. For this reason, patients have to take medication continuously after the surgery. Because the medication is hard for the body to handle, artificial heart valves are more suitable for younger patients.
  * In summary, artificial heart valves are more suitable for younger patients while pig valves are preferable for older ones.

### Task 5

### Task 6

* 题型
  * listen to one lecture: 1 professor, 90-120s
  * preparation: 20s
  * response: 60s
* Template
  * ---主论点（There are two aspects/disadvantages/methods/ways of...）
  * First, ---1st分论. For example, ---1st案例
  * （剩25s）Second, ---2nd分论. For instance, ---2nd案例
* s
  * There are two disadvantages for animals who live in groups.
  * The first one is that they are more visible to predators. Take sardines for an example. Sardines swim in groups, and whales eat them. However, sardines do not swim individually. Therefore, when they swim in groups, it's more easily for whales to spot them.
  * The second example is about bats. It shows that it's hard for moms to care for youngs. Bats live in caves, and moms will go out to find food. But after they come back with food, it's usually difficult for moms to identify their own children. As a result, they sometimes probably end up giving their own food to other bats' children. And then their own children will be starving and will not be fed.
* s
  * In the lecture the professor describes how scientists learn about baby's mathematical abilities.
  * Researchers did an experiment to test baby's ability to add that baby knows one plus one equals two. They first put a doll in front of a baby and lowered the screen to hide the doll. So the baby knows it's there. Then they clearly put another doll behind the screen so there should be two dolls. But researchers secretly took one away and when they lift the screen up, the baby was surprised because it expected to see two dolls but there was only one. We know when a baby is surprised, it stares at the thing that makes it feel surprised. The researchers recorded the baby's eye-movement with a camera and found that the baby stared. So the baby has the ability to add. It knows one doll plus one doll equals two dolls.
* s
  * The professor talks about two kinds of persuasive strategies in advertising.
  * The first strategy is repetition. When a slogan is repeated enough times, we tend to believe what the slogan says. The example is a cr commercial. A guy is driving around and keeps stopping to pick up different people, each time a narrator says "Plenty of rooms for friends", "Plenty of room for family" and so on. If we hear the slogan so many times, we tend to believe the car is spacious even if it's not.
  * The second strategy is using celebrities. We believe celebrities are trustworthy. For example, in a car commercial, if a famous race-car driver is shown in a car and says "I like my car fast", people will believe the car is fast even if it's actually not a very fast car.
* s
  * In the lecture, the professor says in order for art to express meaning or emotion, artists need to combine various visual elements such as color and texture.
  * Different colors can evoke different mood. Red is a strong color so it evokes strong emotions such as extreme joy, excitement and anger, whereas blue is a cool color so it evokes calming effect.
  * As for texture, a rough texture can evoke strong emotions and strength, while a smooth texture is more calming and less emotional. Artists need to combine these elements to express meaning or convey message. For example, if a painting uses strong colors such as red and orange and uses brush strokes to give a rough texture, it will convey a wilder and more chaotic emotion in a viewer than a painting with soft colors and smooth texture.
* s
  * In the lecture, the professor talks about two types of motivation: extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation is external.
  * A person with extrinsic motivation performs a behavior in order to get an external reward. For example, a child who does some housework doesn't really enjoy doing housework. She just wants to obtain some money. If her parents stop giving her money, she might stop doing the housework.
  * However, people with intrinsic motivation do something out of pure pleasure. They do something because they enjoy dong it or they get a sense of accomplishment from it. For example, the professor goes to the gym several times week. She is not going there for marathon training or anything. She goes there because after some exercise she feels good about herself.
