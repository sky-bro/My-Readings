  1. For a country's success, I think a well-rounded medical care system is the most important.
  2. And that's because if you are not healthy, you can't afford to take advantage of business opportunities. And you probably won't be able to focus on your education either. Only after you are healthy, can you go and take advantage of the other two. There are many countries around the world where there might be a good business environment. But because there is not a sufficient medical care system, it actually holds back the development of that country.
  3. So that is why I think it's the most important.

  1. As far as I'm concerned, it's better for university freshmen to live on campus.
  2. First of all, for university first-year students, it's more convenient to live in the dormitories, since they can have meal and go to the supermarket on campus. Because they are not familiar with the situation around campus, they don't have to go far away off campus to buy groceries.
  3. Furthermore, it's much safer to live on campus. As we know, every university has its own Security Office which can guarantee the safety of  the students.
  4. Therefore, I prefer the first-year university students should live on campus.
* s
  1. I prefer to work on assignments individually. There are two reasons.
  2. Firstly, I like to be in a quiet place while studying. If I study in a group, I will easily be interrupted by other group members who talk about irrelevant things.
  3. The second reason is that I'd like to think independently. Studying individually gives me enough time to develop my own ideas. When studying in a group, I'm afraid I will be distracted by other's opinions and thoughts. Like last week, I worked in a group to solve math problems. It turned out that many problems were solved by others not by myself. I felt very unhappy about it.
* 
  1. Personally speaking, going to a new place is more memorable and feels longer than, for example, a seventh straight visit to the Great Wall.
  2. Traveling to a new place makes me feel like a kid again. I like the feeling of being excited and curious before I make my trip to somewhere new. Nowadays, people's jobs come with relatively less vacation time than before, and they should think about avoiding repeating visits to places they've already enjoyed.
  3. Furthermore, I deeply believe that new experiences increase resourcefulness. I have noticed that people who tend to travel to new places feel more ready to embrace change and have a natural ability to overcome problems that others would have difficulties with.
* s
  1. Personally, I prefer living in a historic house.
  2. One of the great reasons why I would choose to live there is the gorgeous design and other details that unique and different about an old historic house, like deliberately designed wooden doors and tea-colored glass windows.
  3. Also living in a historic house will provide me  a richer understanding of history. It offers a taste about the past of the local area, and it could turn you even into a historian. Whether you are really good at history or not, the cool historic house will help you get interested in history.
* s
  1. I don't think people need the so-called talent to be an artist.
  2. I deeply believe that everyone has a potential to be an artist if they choose to be one. I'm sure we've heard enough stories about such and such artist who was not considered to be talented at the time, but became very successful in his or her own style of art.
  3. In my opinion, art has elements of SKILL. If you never learn those basic skills and steps, then of course you will have limited skill! So, people who want to become an accomplished artist should pay a lot of effort to gain the necessary skills in their fields. It is to say that hardwork is far more important than being talented as an artist.
* (Task 1, 记叙文--不考？)
  1. The thing I'd like to talk about today is that I never would've imagined traveling alone to a foreign country.
  2. Last year, I traveled to Thailand all by myself. I only planned the trip for about ten days, and the next thing that happened was me physically being in Thailand. I was like a free bird sight-seeing every day, eating tasty food, and meeting new friends.
  3. In the past, I would never have imagined traveling abroad alone. It sounded uncertain and scary. I often questioned myself that what if I was lost in a foreign country and what would happen if I couldn't communicate with local people. But my last year experience conquered my fear, and now I am very proud of myself.
* s
  1. Personally, I think parents should supervise what their children watch on TV. The reasons are as follow:
  2. Firstly, TV is always flooded with lots of criminal and violent scenes, which are especially bad for children. Parents should prevent them from watching those scenes because they might try to imitate the actions and put them into use.
  3. Secondly, parents should also limit the amount of time children watch TV. If children can choose to watch anything they want, they might end up being addicted to certain TV shows and eventually having poor eyesight. Also, people call those who are overindulgent in watching TV couch potatoes simply because if one spends too much time watching TV shows, he might become obese.
* s
  1. I think learning in traditional classrooms is better.
  2. First of all, I think there are more personal interactions in traditional classrooms than in online courses. Students can have in-person discussions while they can see each other. Possibly, people can become friends in class, whereas in the online courses, students don't know each other, and they miss a chance of making friends.
  3. Also, in a traditional classroom, if a student doesn't understand a concept or an idea, they can raise their hand to ask the teacher directly. While in an online course, there is no chance for students to throw out questions immediately. Students in traditional classrooms not only learn the academic knowledge but also learn basic interpersonal interactions. 
* s
  1. For me, wearing so-called fashionable clothes is not as important, and people shouldn't care much how other people view them based on what they wear.
  2. I think true fashion is about what looks best on you and makes you feel best. It isn't a brand or a certain style that makes you good-looking. I feel like people should find their own style that they like. People often forget that they are beautiful by being themselves and expressing their inner self!
  3. Furthermore, people who dress up fashionably often spend a tremendous amount of time in researching and catching up on the latest trends. In my opinion, that might make people more and more anxious about their appearance and also waste too much time.
* s
  1. I think environmental protection is definitely as import as economic development, if not, more important than the latter one.
  2. We have already wasted and destroyed big amount of natural resources. We must preserve the earth for our children and grandchildren. In any case, poverty and environmental damage are often linked. For example, polluted water can lead to crop failures.
  3. Another reason is that nature plays a key role in human's both physical and mental health. Simply, a beautiful and well-protected environment just makes people and their life happier and more enjoyable. Unfortunately our planet is in danger. Many species of animals and plants are almost extinct.

  1. read one passage: 75~100 words, 45/50s
  2. listen to one dialogue: 2 people (a male student & a female student), 60~80s

  * The university/student in the reading is planning to + 1句，阅读中的主题. In the dialogue, the man/woman agrees/disagrees with the plan in the reading passage.
  * First of all, he/she thinks that 3-4句话（第一个原因）.
  * (剩20秒) Second, he/she continues saying that 4句话左右（第二个原因）
  * Therefore / in a word / all in all, the man/woman doesn't agree / agrees on ...(阅读中的内容)
* s
  * The Computer Department plans to add evening computer classes because daytime computer classes have become overcrowded. But the man in the conversation thinks it's a bad proposal.
  * First of all, the man says that most of the students have already got their own plans in the evenings. They have jobs, family, clubs and social events, so they won't have time to attend the evening classes.
  * The man also says that it's actually going to cost more to open evening classes than to simply buy more computers, since to open new classes needs to hire new teachers and keep the building open late. However, computer is not expensive now. Plus, the computer classrooms are big enough to hold more computers.
* s
  * The student in the reading suggests that the school should change their bike borrowing program. In the dialogue, the man disagrees with the plan in the reading passage.
  * First, he thinks that students often need to borrow the bikes for a long time, sometimes even a whole day. He takes himself and his friends for example. They often go to a park off campus by riding their bikes on weekends. They'd prefer renting those bikes throughout the entire day. Obviously, it's unrealistic for students to return their bicycles after borrowing them for only four hours.
  * Secondly, he continues saying that it's very inconvenient for students to hand over their student ID cards when borrowing the bikes, simply because they need to use their ID cards to enter many building, such as the dining hall and the library. So, he thinks that requiring students to use ID card to borrow bicycles is not as good as asking them to leave a cash deposit.
  * Therefore, the man doesn't agree on the proposal mentioned in the reading passage.
