1. Identify the general idea which is always mentioned by the professor at the beginning of the lecture. most of the times its the answer to the 1st **general question**

3. Body 2 is also a detail question (same as body 1)
4. Body 3 is also a detail question (same)
5. Conclusion is stated by the professor at the end of the lecture
6. The listen to part of conversation type of a question is always noted when there is a change of topic or change in the speaker's tone (make sure to pay attention to these clues)
