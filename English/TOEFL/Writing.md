* Education is one of the most important tools that the society possesses. The right implementation of this tool is one of the greatest ways of assuring the quality of life within a society. At its most basic definition, education is nothing more than the teaching of ideas. The early stages of schooling instill more attitude and social skills than knowledge. As the age and skill level of the student increases, more education is based upon the interest of the student.

  1. In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's idea that reintroducing of gray wolves into the wild is harmful to the ecosystem. The professor asserts that the arguments in the reading passage are not convincing.

  2. Firstly, contrary to the belief in the passage that the increasing number of wolves in the wild could threaten the elk population, which is very important to the ecosystem, the professor asserts that wolves help keep ecological balance, because they hunt elk to the extent that the stability of the ecosystem is well maintained.

  3. Secondly, the author of the passage points out that the wolves wild could be detrimental to the local  farm economy, because domesticated animals like cattle and sheep make for tasty food for wolves, while the lecture notes that if the government subsidizes ranchers who lose sheep and cows due to the attack of wolves, their income and local economic development would not be affected.

  4. Lastly, opposing the author's belief that the locals would fear wolves because it is said that in some states, children were attacked or sometimes even killed by wolves, the professor contends that the local do not fear wolves because they have gotten used to the species and the wolves only attack human beings when they are threatened.

  1. In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's idea that grave found in the north-east of England belongs to King Raedwald. The professor asserts that the grave is not necessarily King Raedwald's.
  2. Firstly, contrary to the belief in the passage that the occupant of the grave is very likely to be King Raedwald since a pair of spoons identified by archaeological technology indicated its date around A.D. 620, while King Raedwald died in A.D. 624, the professor asserts that the technology might not be reliable. The spoons have also been dated to twenty-five years after the king died and the date of the King's death is not exactly accurate. 
  3. Secondly, the author of the passage points out that the spoons engraved with the names of two Catholic missionaries indicated that they might be gifts to Raedwald, because the king converted to Catholicism, while the lecture notes that the spoons engraved with two missionaries' names might be gifts to  anybody who converted to Catholicism, and not necessarily King Raedwald.
  4. Lastly, opposing the author's belief that the grave is luxurious while the north-east of England at that time was poor, so its occupant must be a king, the professor contends that the luxurious grave simply might not be the king's, Perhaps there used to be other rich noblemen buried in such a grave.

  1. Many people enjoy traveling, because they can broaden their horizons, taste different kinds of food, and appreciate beautiful scenery. However, traveling means you will be exposed to unfamiliar environment. Thus, it is crucial to choose a suitable companion to go with you, because a nice companion can share your happiness, reduce your loneliness and help handle problems. Therefore, compared with good food and good locations, I prefer traveling with good friends.
  2. <span style="background: yellow;">To begin with</span>, a good friend can make travel more meaningful and enjoyable. You and your friend can plan the trip together, and experience things together such as hiking, picnicking, and enjoying beautiful scenery and tasty food. Such experiences will help you know each other better and enhance your relationship. For this reason, traveling is not only an activity but also a way to make precious memories in your life.
  3. <span style="background: yellow;">Moreover</span>, a friend would relieve your loneliness when you are traveling, If you travel to somewhere alone, you will not have anyone to talk to. You can read books or listen to music on an MP3 player, but no one would share your happiness during your journey. If you are accompanied by a friend, s/he can take your picture at beautiful scenic spots or other interesting tourist attractions. You can share your photos with each other and talk about the interesting things that happen around you. You may also eat together while having a nice conversation at a local restaurant. With a friend, traveling becomes more interesting and meaningful and we are no longer lonely.
  4. <span style="background: yellow;">Most important of all</span>, a friend can assist you when you are traveling somewhere. We might meet something unfamiliar when we travel. For instance, we might get lost, and a friend who has a great sense of direction could help us find our way. The company of a friend can also relieve fear and stress. Problems may come, but at least you can solve your problems together.
  5. <span style="background: yellow;">In conclusion</span>, traveling with a friend is essential because he or she will share your happiness, help you maintain peace of mind, and provide assistance when you are in trouble. Thus, I think a good friend is more important than other things when I travel on vacation.

## 例证法

* 例证法四要素
  1. 主题句
  2. 解释(讲道理)
  3. 举例(摆证据)
     * 实际/编造 案例（过去）
     * 假设案例（未来）
     * 不一定非得用经典例子
     * 不一定非得用名人，人名
  4. 例子含义的总结
* s
  * 【主题句】To begin with, there is no denying that movies and TV programs produced in one's own country are closer to his daily life and easier to understand. 【解释】The setting of background and plots, and the design of actor's lines all **comply with** the native customs, values and concepts. 【举例】For instance, in some comedies, the laughing points are often hidden in the local dialects or slang that could only be comprehended by the natives. It is difficult for the foreigners to grasp the central meaning, not to mention the subtexts. 【例子含义总结】All these potential factors are combined together to make the movie not as interesting as it is supposed to be in the eyes of a foreign audience.
* s
  * 【主题句】First of all, managing money makes children realize the importance of thrift. 【解释】Saving money is a good habit that needs to be formed at an early age. If children are instructed to save their allowances, they may naturally wonder about the reason to do so. After learning the fact that money is earned through the hard work of their parents, they will no longer waste money on purpose from then on. It paves the way for them to become rational consumers and intelligent investors in the future. 【举例】For instance, I still have a little piggy bank by my side. It is a gift from my uncle, In my childhood, I used to put all my pocket coins into it. With the passing of time, such a habit continues and is to be continued.【例子含义总结】After all, frugality is an essential quality in a financially responsible adult.
* s
  * 【主题句】Obviously, this measure is destined to reduce car use at peak times. 【解释】For fear of being fined or losing money, people may deliberately avoid driving to work. Paying fees proves to be the most effective way to manipulate people's personal behavior in public, as it is in line with people's general psychological state.【举例】Such an adoption is actually not unique to a single nation. For instance, traffic jam fees were introduced in Singapore in 1975. Since then, Sweden, Britain, Norway, Italy, and China have followed suit. 【例子子含义总结】Due to the measures implemented, the traffic volumes were brought down by between 10 to 20 percent.
* s
  * First of all, taking good care of others is a primary step to become a responsible individual. Just like a baby who lives under the endless care from its mother, an animal also relies largely on the affectionate care from its owner. If a child has been given the chance to play the role of a little mother, she would have a further comprehension about what love and care really mean. She may be determined to render the greatest care to her pet and try to make it healthier and stronger. In fact such a psychological feedback is helpful to children's mental growth and prepares them for greater responsibilities.

  * 【主题句】Stress stems from the fierce competition among colleagues. 【条件】If every person aspires to success, 【结果】then this very desire will push people to scramble for limited positions and resources at all costs, 【影响】thus creating intense pressure on everyone.
  * 【主题句】Watching TV too much tends to have an unfavorable influence on the family relationship, 【条件】by which I mean if one spends the vast majority of his spare time on television, 【结果】he will lack sufficient time for communication with the family members, 【影响】which may possibly result in the alienation in the family. 
  * 【主题句】However, awareness ought to be aroused to avoid the phenomenon of filling a post without real qualifications. 【条件】If equal grade is given to all group members, 【结果】there is a hidden possibility that certain members might refuse to contribute wholeheartedly. Just as what is depicted in the famous Chinese fable, some players might pretend to make contributions in disguise. 【影响】Such dishonest behavior is also destructive to the quality of a group and must be strictly avoided.
